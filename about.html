   <h1>About Me</h1> 
   <p class="about-me-paragraph">Hi! My name is Amie. I am a clinical research manager at a small start-up focused on womens health. After working in the same field for so long I wanted to try something completley different. I came across SheCodes while scrolling through my Instagram and decided to check it out. I took the free introduction to coding class first and was instantly intrigued and wanted to learn more. I initially only signed up for the basic SheCodes workshop but had such a great experience I decided to sign up for the pro membership to complete all the offered workshops. I never thought I would be able to learn to code let along be able to build my own website. I really have enjoyed my coding journey and cannot wait to continue coding! Keep and eye on what I am working on next.

          "It seems that the more places I see and experience, the bigger I
          realize the world to be. The more I become aware of, the more I
          realize how relatively little I know of it, how many places I have
          still to go, how much more there is to learn. Maybe that's
          enlightenment enough - to know that there is no final resting place
          of the mind, no moment of smug clarity. Perhaps wisdom, at least for
          me, means realizing how small I am, and unwise, and how far I have
          yet to go."-Anthony Bourdain
